                    <h4>The Project</h4>

                    <p>
                        PhysioWAT (Wearable Analytics Tech) consists of developing a novel web platform to support
                        reproducible research based on physiological sensors. This platform also offers a connection
                        to smartphones, on which it is possible to collect data from wearable sensors and store it
                        on a relational database. Users can upload their data and analyze the stored data online,
                        visualize data in different graphs, and save it.

                    <h4>The Team</h4>

                    <p>We are an international group of motivated and passionate students aged 17-18 years old. We were
                        provided with the opportunity of taking part in WebValley 2015. WebValley is the FBK summer
                        school for dissemination of interdisciplinary research. The starting point is the philosophy of
                        combining open source tools, FBK research products, and the creativity of participants in order
                        to solve a real problem using new technologies. </p>

                    <h4>The case studies</h4>

                    <p>The project focuses on the classification of stereotypical patterns in ASD children and on the
                        synchronization of physiological responses in different relationships. The project was
                        commissioned and supported by the ABP-lab (UniTN & NTY). Other than the raw data we were given,
                        we also collected "synthetical data" with wearable sensors. </p>
